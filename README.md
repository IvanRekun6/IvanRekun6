**EXPERIENCE**

[N-iX](https://www.n-ix.com/): 08/2024 – PRESENT 1.5+ YEARS 

- Developed chatbot with RAG and agentic features for a bank in Arab Emirates, using AWS Bedrock.
- Implemented multi-agent orchestration and secure tool calling via MCP. Exposed via REST APIs (FastAPI). Achieved **98.3%** intent classification accuracy.
- Explored SLMs for latency-sensitive scenarios to balance model quality, latency and cost.
- Delivered autonomous transaction handling (balance checks, transfers, payments). Cut support workload by **50%** and reduced customer service operational costs by **70%**.
- Reduced website traffic by **82%** as users adopted the AI agent as primary interface.
- Implemented GenAI solution for telecom firm via fine-tuning two LLMs, which summarizes customer support requests, speeding up troubleshooting by up to **40%**.

  ***Technologies:** AWS Bedrock, OpenSearch, Lambda, LangChain, LangGraph, Pinecone, FastAPI*

  [INTELLIAS](https://intellias.com/): 03/2023 – 07/2024 1.4 YEARS

- Developed LLM-based knowledge platform for global automotive client, unifying distributed data sources and enabling natural-language queries for 10,000+ employees. 
- Worked on context engineering: built RAG pipelines with retrieval optimization, embeddings and prompt orchestration, achieving **92%** retrieval accuracy and **2%** hallucination rate. 
- Implemented AI-native multimodal search (text, images, videos, audio) using vector databases. 
- Fine-tuned LLM on domain-specific automotive data, improving contextual relevance by **23%**. 
- Built LLMOps pipelines with automated CI/CD, monitoring, and retraining. 
- Delivered features accelerating onboarding by **30%** and boosting productivity on knowledge tasks.

  ***Technologies**: Azure (AI Search, Kubernetes Service), Hugging Face, PyTorch, LlamaIndex, MLflow, Docker, Airflow*

  [NAPOLEON IT](https://napoleonit.ru/): 06/2021 – 01/2023 1.6 YEARS

- Contributed to speech analytics platform processing call center conversations (audio -> transcription with Whisper -> NLP -> business scoring).
- Fine-tuned NLP models (BERT-based) for script compliance detection, dialogue stage classification, intent detection, and topic modeling.
- Engineered audio feature extraction pipelines (pitch, speech rate).
- Developed text and acoustic sentiment analysis models to detect customer dissatisfaction.
- Implemented an automated Quality Assurance scoring system replicating manual QA checklists with ML-based evaluation (XGBoost).
- Productionized ML services using Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, and gRPC API with monitoring and drift detection.
- In my first project, worked on predictive B2B churn system using scikit-learn and experimenting with neural networks. Designed ETL pipeline to aggregate 80+ behavioral features (logins, feature adoption, support tickets). Predicted 60-day churn risk; achieved precision **84.7%.**
